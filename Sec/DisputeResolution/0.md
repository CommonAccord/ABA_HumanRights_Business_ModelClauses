Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, however, at any point in the proceedings under this Article {DisputeResolution.Xnum}, the parties may agree to engage the services of a neutral facilitator to assist in resolving any Dispute.  

Note=8.2 is optional.

2.Ti=Confidentiality

2.sec=All documents and information concerning the Dispute, including all submissions of the parties, all evidence submitted in connection with any proceedings, all transcripts or other recordings of hearings, all orders, decisions and awards of the arbitral tribunal and any documents produced as a result of any informal resolution of a dispute, shall be confidential, except with the consent of both parties or where, and to the extent, disclosure is required of a party (a) by legal duty, (b) to protect or pursue a legal right, or (c) in relation to legal proceedings before a court or other competent authority.

4.Ti=Informal Good Faith Negotiations Up the Line

4.sec=The parties shall try to settle their Dispute amicably between themselves by good faith negotiations, initially in the normal course of business at the operational level.  If a Dispute is not resolved at the operational level, the parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute by negotiation between executives who hold, at a minimum, the office(s) of [TITLE(S)].  Either party may initiate the executive negotiation process at any time and from time to time by providing notice [in accordance with Section {RejectionOfGoods.1.3.Xnum}] (the “{DefT.Dispute_Notice}”).  Within no more than five (5) days  after the Dispute Notice has been given, the receiving party shall submit to the other a written response (the “{DefT.Response}”).

5.Ti=Mediation

Note=There appears to be an extraneous "]" in "through [arbitration][litigation] under Section {DisputeResolution.6.Xnum}]" in the following section. Presumably, this indicates the end of an optional span, but it is unclear where it begins. The "]" is also missing in the PDF mccs-full-report.pdf.  Perhaps it is merely extraneous. 

5.sec=If the parties do not resolve any Dispute within the periods specified in Section {DisputeResolution.4.Xnum}, either party may, by notice given in accordance with Section {RejectionOfGoods.1.3.Xnum} (the “{DefT.Mediation_Notice}”), invite the other to resolve the Dispute under the [insert name of rules] as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the “{DefT.Mediation_Rules}”).  The language to be used in the mediation shall be [language].  If such invitation is accepted, a single mediator shall be chosen by the Parties. If, within {Mediation.RespondToInvitationWithin.days} following the delivery of the Mediation Notice, the invitation to mediate is not accepted, the parties shall resolve the Dispute through {arbitration//litigation} under Section {DisputeResolution.6.Xnum}]  [If the parties are unable to agree upon the appointment of a mediator, then one shall be appointed by the {Arbitration.Institution.Name}.
